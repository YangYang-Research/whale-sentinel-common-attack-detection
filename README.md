This module plays a critical role in Whale Sentinel (WS) security by detecting, analyzing, and mitigating common cyberattack patterns through an advanced rule-based detection framework.

Key Functions:

✅ Comprehensive Attack Detection – Leverages a robust rule base to systematically analyze incoming threats, including SQL injection, XSS, and unauthorized access attempts.

✅ Real-Time Threat Mitigation – Identifies suspicious activities and applies dynamic security controls to neutralize potential exploits before they escalate.

✅ Flexible Patching & Self-Healing Security – Enables adaptive patching to address emerging vulnerabilities instantly, ensuring rapid remediation without disrupting system operations.

✅ Seamless Integration with WS Security Framework – Works in sync with other Whale Sentinel services to deliver continuous security monitoring, active threat prevention, and instantaneous response.
